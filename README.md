# FDA-Data-Analysis
Repository for analyzing public FDA data regarding branded food properties with regards to nutrition.

# Replication
Assuming the file is still available on the government FDA website, running `download_data.sh` will download the data into the `data` directory. From this, `Branded Food Initial Data Cleaning` and `Main Food Nutrient Notebook.ipynb` can be run assuming your python enivonrment contains the requirements in `requirements.txt`.
